\section{Introduction and Description of Work%
  \label{introduction-and-description-of-work}%
}

Finding a consensus is a key functionality of any strongly consistent distributed system. Raft \cite{raft} is a new consensus algorithm that is designed to be used instead of Paxos \cite{paxos} whilst being easier to understand and implement correctly. It models the distributed system as a replicated state machine using a replicated log. Raft features a strong leader, an explicit membership change mechanism and a (partial) correctness proof.\footnote{“Safety Proof and Formal Specification for Raft”, accessed October 17, 2013. \url{http://raftuserstudy.s3-website-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/proof.pdf}}

By default, Raft uses majority voting to find quorums. Both the initial paper and the separate correctness proof suggest that it should be possible to replace majority voting by other voting schemes.

Structured voting schemes \cite{voting} impose a logical structure on the set of processes and use structural properties to specify quorum systems. They all have a notion of \emph{write quorum}, with the property that any two write quorums overlap. The Grid protocol, for instance, logically arranges all nodes in a rectangular grid. A write quorum in the Grid protocol consists of the union of one entire row of nodes and one entire column of nodes. Clearly, any two such write quorums intersect. Since this intersection property is the only thing the correctness proof requires, replacing majority consensus by a write quorum computed from a structured voting scheme would not affect the correctness of the Raft algorithm.

Structured voting protocols have the drawback that they may fail to generate a quorum even though more than half of the nodes are ready. They may, on the other hand, find a quorum even when less than half of the nodes are ready. Majority voting will always succeed in finding a quorum in the former case, and it will necessarily fail to do so in the latter case. Thus structured voting schemes allow for a trade-off, being less reliable than majority voting if most nodes are available, but more reliable if the majority of nodes is not available. It should be noted that structured voting protocols scale better than majority voting when the distributed system consists of a large number of nodes; when there are few nodes, majority voting tends to perform better.

The aim of this project is twofold: To add structured voting protocols to an existing implementation of the Raft consensus algorithm, and to compare the perfomance of different structured voting protocols with the performance of Raft's default majority consensus voting.


\section{Starting Point%
  \label{starting-point}%
}
%
\begin{itemize}

\item Raft: I have listened to a recorded lecture on Raft by one of its creators. I have skimmed through the relevant sections of the paper and the seperate correctness prooof.

\item Rafter: Several implementations of the Raft consensus algorithm exist. One of them is \emph{Rafter}\footnote{Andrew J. Stone. “Rafter: An Erlang library application which implements the Raft consensus protocol”, accessed October 17, 2013. \url{https://github.com/andrewjstone/rafter}}, an open source Erlang library written by Andrew J. Stone at Basho, Inc. It is a work-in-progress, but mostly feature-complete, implementation of Raft. I will use its code as a basis for this project.

\item Concurrent \& Distributed Systems: The IB lecture courses \emph{Concurrent Systems} and \emph{Distributed Systems} have given me an appreciation for the challenges that such systems pose. During my internship this summer, I implemented a minimalistic distributed key-value store that used structured voting protocols to guarantee consistency as a proof of concept in Node.js/Javascript.

\item Programming: Most of the code I will be writing for this project will be in Erlang, a language I have no prior experience with. However, I am familiar with functional programming from both the IA Standard ML exercises and from small personal projects in Haskell and OCaml.

\end{itemize}


\section{Substance and Structure of the Project%
  \label{substance-and-structure-of-the-project}%
}

The aim of this project is to add structured voting protocols to Rafter, and to benchmark different structured voting protocols against each other and against Raft's default majority consensus algorithm. The project has the following main sections:
\newcounter{listcnt0}
\begin{list}{\arabic{listcnt0}.}
{
\usecounter{listcnt0}
\setlength{\rightmargin}{\leftmargin}
}

\item Familiarisation with the programming language Erlang, Raft, and the Rafter source code.

\item Detailed design of the data structure to represent voting structures and the algorithms to generate and interpret them. Developing and testing the code to generate and interpret voting structures separately.

\item Incorporating the above algorithms and data structures into Rafter so they can be used to find quorums.

\item Developing and testing a benchmark suite for a distributed key-value store on top of Rafter.

\item Setting up the project so that it can be run as a distributed key-value store in the Amazon EC2 infrastructure and running the benchmark test on an Amazon EC2 cluster.

\item Writing the dissertation.
\end{list}


\section{Variations%
  \label{variations}%
}
%
\begin{itemize}

\item Heterogeneous voting scheme configuration

\item Advanced key-value store: Queries, transactions

\item Profiling and performance tuning

\item ?

\end{itemize}


\section{Success Criteria%
  \label{success-criteria}%

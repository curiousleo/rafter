\section{Progress Report%
  \label{progress-report}%
}

At the time of this writing, my project is roughly on schedule. During Michaelmas term, I fell behind by two to three weeks, but fortunately after lectures and supervisions had finished, I was able to catch up with the work plan and have stayed on top of it since.

As laid out in my original work plan, I started by familiarising myself with Erlang. I produced a working implementation of a banker's deque (ref. Okasaki) with type annotations for Dialyzer and QuickCheck unit tests. In order to learn about asynchronous programming with Erlang, I wrote a distributed benchmarking tool. Writing asynchronous code in Erlang using OTP idioms turned out to be more difficult than I had anticipated. Completing the benchmarking tool took longer than expected, and this was why I fell behind the schedule even though the project had barely started.

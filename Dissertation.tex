\section{Motivation\label{sc:motivation}}

As ever-increasing amounts of data are being handled in commercial settings as well as in research, distributed systems for processing and storage are becoming more and more ubiquitous. One main driver of this development is the need to increase fault tolerance.

According to Eric Brewer's famous \textsc{cap} theorem \autocite{cap}, a partition tolerant system cannot be both strictly consistent and maximally available.\footnote{The terms consistency, availability and partition tolerance are defined in \autoref{ssc:cap-acid-and-base}.} Many recent distributed data stores sacrifice consistency for availability. Some applications, however, require strong consistency guarantees -- data backup and configuration management systems, for example. Consensus protocols like Paxos \autocite{paxos} and Raft \autocite{raft} guarantee consistency at the cost of decreased availability.

In this project, I added support for structured voting schemes to an existing implementation of Raft. My aim was increase the availability and scalability of data storage systems built on top of this implementation while still providing the same consistency guarantees as the original Raft algorithm.

Increasing the availability of a consistent distributed system would have two effects:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Applications that require consistency and already use a consensus algorithm that provides consistency could have their availability increased by migrating to this new implementation;
    \item Applications that require high availability and currently run an algorithm that does not guarantee consistency, might switch to this new implementation too.
\end{itemize}

\section[Introduction to distributed systems]{Introduction to distributed systems: \textsc{cap}, \textsc{acid} and \textsc{base}\label{ssc:cap-acid-and-base}}

Eric Brewer's famous \textsc{cap} theorem states that any distributed system can provide at most two out of the three desirable properties consistency (\textsc{c}), availability (\textsc{a}), and partition tolerance (\textsc{p}).\autocite{cap} The following definitions are adapted from \textcite{capproof}:

\begin{description}
    \item[Consistency] There must exist a total order on all operations such that each operation looks as if it were completed at a single instant. An important consequence of this \emph{linearisable} (or \emph{atomic}) consistency guarantee is that any read operation that begins after a write operation completes must return that value, or the result of a later write operation.\footnote{As \textcite{capproof} point out, the term \emph{consistency} is highly overloaded. Note that the above notion of atomic consistency subsumes what is called atomicity and consistency in the context of \textsc{acid} (\enquote{atomic, consistent, isolated, durable}) databases.}
    \item[Availability] Every request received by a non-failing node in the system must result in a response.
    \item[Partition tolerance] The system continues to operate despite arbitrary message loss. This includes network partitions, where all messages sent from nodes in one component of the partition to nodes in another component are lost.
\end{description}

Out of those three, partition tolerance is required in almost all cases. As \citeauthor{needp} puts it in his article \citetitle{needp}:

\begin{quote}
    For a distributed \dots{} system to \emph{not} require partition tolerance it would have to run on a network which is guaranteed to never drop messages \dots{} and whose nodes are guaranteed to never [fail]. [These] types of systems \dots{} don't exist.
\end{quote}

This leaves designers of distributed systems with the task of finding the right trade-off between consistency and availability, both of which should be considered as continuous rather than binary properties \autocite{cap12}. With the rise of commercial databases of unprecedented scale over the last decade, consistency (in its strict form as defined above) is in many cases sacrificed for increased availability.%
\footnote{This has been heralded as a paradigm shift from the \textsc{acid} to the \textsc{base} (\enquote{basically available, soft state, eventually consistent}) model \parencite{base}.} %
The authors of \citetitle{dynamo} describe this as follows:%
\footnote{Notable other eventually consistent systems include Cassandra \parentext{\citeurl{cassandra}}, Riak \parentext{\citeurl{riak}} and HBase \parentext{\citeurl{hbase}}.}

\begin{quote}
    For systems prone to server and network failures, availability can be increased by using optimistic replication techniques, where changes are allowed to propagate to replicas in the background, and concurrent, disconnected work is tolerated. The challenge with this approach is that it can lead to \emph{conflicting changes which must be detected and resolved} \dots{} Dynamo is designed to be an eventually consistent data store; that is all updates reach all replicas eventually.
\end{quote}

The conflict detection and resolution mechanisms required by eventually consistent systems increase their complexity compared to consistent systems, which do not need them. This begs the question: are there techniques that could be used to improve availability without giving up on consistency, allowing for simpler systems? The \textsc{cap} theorem tells us that we can never build strictly consistent and maximally available systems, but a different trade-off might be possible.

\section{Introduction to the Raft consensus algorithm\label{ssc:raft-consensus-algorithm}}

Although still a draft, the paper describing the new Raft consensus algorithm \autocite{raft} has created a lot of buzz; dozens of implementations in various languages and stages of development already exist.\footnote{For an up-to-date list of Raft implementations, see \url{http://raftconsensus.github.io/\#implementations}.}

In the following, I will give a short overview of the Raft consensus algorithm. It is meant to introduce the terminology required for the Implementation and Evaluation chapters.

At its core, Raft uses a replicated state machine architecture, implemented using a replicated log (see \autoref{fig:replicated-state-machine}): each log contains the same commands in the same order, so each state machine processes the same sequence of commands. Since the state machines are assumed to be deterministic, each computes the same state and the same sequence of outputs.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth, keepaspectratio]{Images/Replicated_state_machine.pdf}
    \caption{Replicated state machine architecture}
    \label{fig:replicated-state-machine}
\end{figure}

Raft implements this replicated log architecture using a collections of servers (a cluster) communicating via remote procedure calls (\textsc{rpc}s), of which there are two: \texttt{appendEntries} and \texttt{requestVote}. At any given time each server is either a \emph{leader}, \emph{follower}, or \emph{candidate} (see \autoref{fig:consensus-fsm}). In normal operation, there is exactly one leader and all other servers are followers.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth, keepaspectratio]{Images/Consensus_FSM.pdf}
    \caption{Server states and the transitions between them}
    \label{fig:consensus-fsm}
\end{figure}

\minisec{Leader election}

A server remains in follower state as long as it receives valid heartbeats (\appendEntriesRPC s that carry no entries) from a leader or candidate. If a follower receives no communication over a period of time, it assumes that there is no viable leader and begins an election to choose a new one. To do so, it transitions to candidate state and issues \requestVoteRPC s in parallel to all other servers in the cluster. Then one of three things happens: (a) the candidate wins the election, (b) another server establishes itself as leader, or (c) a period of time goes by without a winner, in which case a new election is started.

Each server receiving a \requestVoteRPC{} will vote for at most one candidate, on a first-come-first-served basis. Once a candidate wins an election, it becomes the new leader and sends heartbeat messages to every other server to establish its authority.

\minisec{Log replication}

Each client request to a leader contains a command to be executed by the replicated state machines. The leader appends the command to its log as a new entry, then issues \appendEntriesRPC s in parallel to all other servers to replicate the entry. When the entry has been safely replicated, the leader applies the entry to its state machine and returns the result of that execution to the client (for a complete description of what it means for an entry to be \enquote{safely replicated}, see subsection 5.3 of the Raft paper.)

\minisec{Safety guarantees}

In order to guarantee overall correctness, different components of Raft are designed to make sure certain well-defined safety properties are true at all times. These properties are shown to hold and then used to prove correctness in the separate correctness proof \autocite{raftproof}.

Since my project involved changing the way in which quorums\footnote{A \emph{quorum} is a minimal subset of the cluster that an operation has to obtain votes from in order to be performed. Majority voting, for example, specifies that any set of servers containing at least half the servers in the entire cluster constitutes a quorum.} are constructed, I had to pay special attention to the Election Safety property (stating that there can be at most one leader at any given time) and all the steps in the proof to do with quorums, in order to make sure all the desired properties still hold.

\section{Introduction to structured voting schemes\label{ssc:structured-voting-schemes}}

By taking into account the identity of nodes, as opposed to just counting them as in the majority consensus algorithm, we can build \emph{structured} voting schemes.

\minisec{Quorum systems}

A quorum system is defined as a tuple of a read and a write quorum set whose elements are called read quorums and write quorums, respectively. These are constructed such that every write quorum intersects with every other write quorum and with every read quorum in at least one process; read quorums need not intersect \autocite{voting}.

The key realisation that lead to this project was that write quorums have precisely the property required for Raft's leader election, namely that any two write quorums intersect. From this point on, \emph{quorum} will mean \emph{write quorum} unless specifically noted otherwise.

\minisec{Structured voting by example}

Structured voting schemes impose a logical structure on the set of processes and use structural properties to specify quorum systems. For example, the structured Grid Protocol arranges processes in a logical rectangular grid \autocite{grid}. A write quorum consists of all processes from a complete column plus one process from each column.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    {\ttfamily\color{gray}
    \begin{tabular}{c | c | c | c}

        \hline
        \voted{I} & \voted{J} & K & L \\
        \hline
        M & \voted{N} & O & \voted{P} \\
    \end{tabular}
    }
    \caption[Grid protocol quorum table]{A Grid Protocol quorum: The entire second column (\texttt{B}, \texttt{F}, \texttt{J}, \texttt{N}) and one process from each other column (\texttt{I}, \texttt{G}, \texttt{P}) are included}
    \label{fig:grid-quorum}
\end{figure}

\minisec{Specifying voting structures}

\citeauthor{generators} present \emph{tree-shaped voting structures} as a universal quorum system representation in the form of semantics-enriched tree graphs. They are produced by voting structure specific \emph{voting structure generators} \autocite{generators}.

In a tree-shaped voting structure, each node without children (a \enquote{physical node}) represents a process. Nodes with children (called \enquote{virtual nodes}) represent the structure of the voting scheme. The tree is to be interpreted such that votes flow upwards, from the physical nodes (the leaves of the tree) up to the virtual node at its root.

When a physical node casts its vote, its votes are added to the votes its parent virtual node has already received. If the sum of those votes equals or exceeds the parent node's threshold, then the parent node in turn passes its vote to its parent. An annotated example is given in \autoref{fig:grid4}.

\end{figure}

The main software engineering technique I used to increase my chances of success were \emph{modularisation} and \emph{testing} using appropriate measures.

\subsection{Modularisation}

This technique permeated all levels of the project. The code itself was written in a functional style, where each function typically spans between one and ten lines. This increased understandability by forcing me to split larger functions into smaller ones, each performing a small and well-defined task.

All development took place using Git, a popular version control system.\footnote{Git (\url{http://git-scm.com}) is an open source distributed version control system emphasising speed, originally developed by Linux Torvalds to simplify the development of the Linux kernel. Git supports very cheap and fast branching, a feature I used extensively in this project.} I used Git's branching facility to keep independent pieces of code separate during their development. Whenever code from different branches needed to be combined, I merged the required feature branches into a temporary branch. For convenience, all documentation (including the proposal, the progress presentation and this very report) was kept under its own branch in the same repository.

\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{l X}
        \toprule
        \textit{Branch name} & \textit{Description} \\
        \midrule
        \texttt{structured-voting} & Voting algorithms and voting structure generators \\
        \texttt{memcached} & Memcached frontend \\
        \texttt{time-to-consensus} & Time-to-consensus logging \\
        \texttt{failure-command} & Follower failure simulation \\
        \texttt{ec2-integration} & Amazon \ECC instance administration scripts \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabularx}
    \caption{Feature branches used in the project repository}
    \label{tab:branches}
\end{table}

The voting algorithm, the voting structure visualiser and the generators for the Majority Protocol and the Grid Protocol were initially written and tested independently from Rafter. Only once I was sufficiently confident in the correctness of the code did I integrate it with Rafter. This integration process turned out to take much less time than expected -- due to the modularity of Rafter, only few changes were required in order for it to use my generalised voting functions.

\subsection{Testing}

In general, I did a lot of manual testing in the early stages of the development of each component. Once the code had reached a stage where testing by hand did not uncover any more bugs, I wrote a QuickCheck test for that component.

Voting structure generators, in particular, were tested using two complementary methods: visually, I checked them for correctness using the voting structure visualiser (see XXX); a QuickCheck property tested for internal integrity.

\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[height=0.45\textheight, keepaspectratio]{Images/Coverage_summary.pdf}
    \caption[Unit test coverage]{Unit test coverage of the structured voting code. Note in particular the high coverage of the last four modules, which were written as part of this project.}
    \label{tab:coverage}
\end{table}

The QuickCheck tests, in their simplest form, consist of \emph{generators} (not to be confused with voting structure generators) and a set of functions specifying the \emph{properties} of the generated objects. QuickCheck then randomly instantiates objects using the generators, and tests if their behave as expected.

\autoref{tab:coverage} shows a screenshot of the test coverage report generated by the EUnit library. I modified four out the five original test modules and added another four to cover my structured voting code. Of the modules shown, I edited \texttt{rafter\_config}, \texttt{rafter\_consensus\_fsm} and \texttt{rafter\_consensus\_sup} and wrote the bottom four modules (all starting with \texttt{rafter\_voting}) from scratch.

\minisec{Generator example}

In \texttt{test/rafter\_gen.erl}, the function \texttt{vstruct()} generates a voting structure, proceeding as follows: It
\begin{inparaenum}[(a)]
    \item creates a list of unique identifiers of random length uniformly distributed between three and 40,
    \item picks a voting structure generator at random (Majority Protocol, Grid Protocol, or Tree Quorum Protocol),
    \item generates additional parameters depending on the voting structure generator chosen,
    \item calls the chosen voting structure generator with the shuffled list of identifiers and any additional parameters as arguments, and
    \item returns the resulting voting structure.
\end{inparaenum}

This generator function is used wherever a test requires a voting structure. As the tests are run a large number of times, the probability increases that all relevant combinations of parameters are tested at some point.

\minisec{Property example}

The file \texttt{test/rafter\_voting\_majority\_eqc.erl} defines a property of the Majority Protocol in the function \texttt{prop\_majority\_quorum()}. In essence, this property states that an election succeeds if and only if more than half of the nodes agree (\(v \ge \lceil n \, / \, 2 \rceil \), where \(v\) is the number of votes and \(n\) the total number of processes.)

\subsection{Rafter and structured voting\label{ssc:rafter-structured-voting}}

XXX

In the inception phase of the project, I was faced with the decision of whether to use and existing implementation of Raft or write one from scratch. Since I was primarily interested in implementing structured voting algorithms, and many implementations of Raft already exist, I decided to adapt an existing implementation.

Having written a distributed key-value store in Node.js during an internship, I decided to look for an implementation that used a programming language with built-in support for concurrency that I had heard of: Erlang. Out of the five Raft implementations written in Erlang, Andrew Stone's \emph{Rafter} seemed to be the most mature.\footnote{Andrew Stone is a Distributed Systems Developer at Basho Technologies (\url{http://basho.com}). Rafter is an open source project hosted on GitHub (\url{http://github.com/andrewjstone/rafter}).}

The choice of Erlang and Rafter then dictated my primary programming toolkit:

\begin{description}
    \item[Erlang] A dynamically typed functional programming language originally designed to run Ericsson's telephony switches, Erlang features a run-time system with built-in support for concurrency, distribution and fault tolerance.
    \item[Open Telephony Platform] Commonly referred to as \enquote{the \textsc{otp}}, the Open Telephony Platform provides a set of Erlang libraries and design principles providing middle-ware to develop Erlang applications.
    \item[QuickCheck] A commercial testing framework for Erlang by Quvik \textsc{se}. Rafter's unit and integration tests use it, and I adapted and amended them to cover my code as well.
    \item[Dialyzer] The \enquote{Discrepancy Analyzer for Erlang programs} is used to statically type check Erlang programs.

The core voting algorithm as illustrated in \autoref{fig:grid4-state} lends itself well to a recursive implementation, given that it is represented in a tree-shaped data structure. The data structures

Each node has one vote. \texttt{A} votes first (maroon). \(V_4\) has a threshold of one, so it votes as well. \(V_2\) and \(V_6\) both have threshold two, so their votes are pending. Then \texttt{B} votes (blue), triggering a vote from \(V_5\). Now both \(V_4\) and \(V_5\) have voted, so \(V_2\)'s threshold of two is reached and it votes, too. At this stage, \(V_1\) and \(V_7\) each require one more vote. Lastly, \texttt{C} votes (green). \(V_4\) has already voted, so nothing happens in this branch. \(V_6\) receives a second vote, so it passes its vote to \(V_3\), immediately triggering it to vote to the root node \(V_1\), where the threshold is now reached, ending the election.}
